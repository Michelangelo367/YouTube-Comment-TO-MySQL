## Features

This program using Youtube API crawls **much more youtube video comment** than using selenium and beautifulsoup python module.

| [Left] using selenium and chromedriver                      | [Right] using youtube API and MySQL                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Max comment = 1500 <br />total video's comment = 15,000,000 | Max comment = up to 15,000,000 <br />total video's comment = 15,000,000 |

This program is slower than the way to selenium crawling But more precise than that way

If you're using **Bigdata and Artificial Intelligence** or if you're a **Data Scientist and Data Analyst** , You must need to this program to use much many youtube comment data and to analyze youtube environment.

   charset of Database Schema? Ex) utf8 : 
   ```
